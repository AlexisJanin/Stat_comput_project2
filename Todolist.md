## Things to try of the packages :
- Time vs sample size __Started and advanced - Alexis__ left: Precisely define the outcome we want from each package + details
- (and later same parameters as below)

## CV error VS:
- Sample size
- Bandwidth
- Degree (look at default, maybe 2)
- Noise

## function package related stuff:
- check for "TODO"'s left inside it  (ctrl+f - TODO)
- Normalize the functions so they're all interesting on the same interval
- Normalize the functions so their range is in the same order _useful only if we desire to compare a bit the function, but never useless_

### Try to linearly/randomly spaced points (runif)
