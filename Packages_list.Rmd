Data: chosen? Should that be a simulation study ? so we just create datasets with known function and some random noise (or kind of any dataset available in R as for assignment 4)

Criteria: Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)

Packages:
(different in bandwidth selection methods)

locpoly {KernSmooth}                    __Done__
Lpoly                            -in Strata?
NonpModelCheck (version 4.1) :: localpoly.reg    -removed?
Lokerns                        ~Done

(maybe lm+poly)



Comparison:
Calculation Speed- Number of points
Number of steps to conversion - Number of Points
Consistency: growing number of points- Cross Validations
Accuracy-bandwidth+degree
